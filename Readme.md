      Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
      <br>
      <p>The client is <em><strong>Draw It or LOSE IT!</strong></em> They currently only have an Android based app and would like to make it online based and cross-              platform. Thew game must have the ability to run multible instances of the game at once, each having players and teams.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
      <br>
      <p>Understanding browswer's limitations i.e., what features each browser has and how it can affect the user's expierence.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
       What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
       <br>
      <p>This helped by understanding the enviornment on which I should develop the code on whether that be on Linux, Windows, or Mac</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
       If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
       <br>
      <p>This would probrably be the section on Client side and server side Development requirements. This I misread and thought how I would implement the system as              opposed to what each platform, that being Linux,Mac,Windows and Mobile, and Finding what thier strengths and weaknesses are when using a server. </p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
       How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
       <br>
      <p>This is by User Stories where we look at the clients wants and needs as a guideline onto designing the product. This is important as it is what the client is          expect a program to do.</p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
       How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
       <br>
      <p>The way I approached designing software is understanding the clients needs and wants in a given program. I also look onto keeping security in mind esspecially          when it comes to logging into the application. Another big thing is how a operating system handles at scale. I find that perforance wize, Linux and it's complicated memory stacking helps in memory allocation and can stack memory in various locations to perserve optimal perforance.</p>
